We have whole genome sequence data from diploids and triploids and want to see if gene copy number varies, specifically rRNA genes.

Reference genome - Pacific oyster, _Crassostrea gigas_


```{bash}
cd ../data

curl -O https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/panopea/Cg-roslin/cgigas_uk_roslin_v1_genomic-mito.fa
```


Get sequence files for individual oysters...







# Align individual files to genome.
