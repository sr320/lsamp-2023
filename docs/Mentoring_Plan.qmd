# Introduction

This 10-week research internship will focus primarily on the study of Pacific oysters, specifically investigating how environmental stress factors and triploidy - the condition of having three sets of chromosomes - affect these bivalve mollusks. The Pacific oyster, a key species in marine ecosystems and global aquaculture, possesses a remarkable ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. However, the increasing stressors resulting from climate change, such as ocean acidification and temperature fluctuations, pose significant challenges to their survival and reproductive success. Furthermore, many Pacific oysters are deliberately bred to be triploid to enhance growth and survival rates. Throughout the internship, we will rigorously examine these interactions, employing a blend of laboratory experimentation and data analysis to explore these intricate dynamics. This research opportunity will provide a comprehensive understanding of the delicate balance between genetic variation, environmental stress, and survival in Pacific oysters, offering valuable insights for future conservation strategies and sustainable aquaculture practices.

# Objectives

-   Document prior research that offers explanation of physiological difference in triploid and diploid oysters

-   Characterize differential gene expression in triploid oysters compared to diploid oysters in response to environmental stress.

-   Evaluate differences in gene copy number variation between diploid and triploid oysters.
